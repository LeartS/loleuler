## FUCKS

### WAT IS TIS????
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) PROBS SOLVED USIN LOLCODE

### Y????
Y NT?????

### THESE WORK FOR REALZ????
FUK U MAN IF U DONT BLEIVE ME INSTL [LCI](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci) N
SEE FO URSELF

## Seriously
This started as a "fun" way to lose time, but I've since found out
it kinda is a good exercise.

### Doesn't Project Euler ask to not publish solutions to their problems?
Yes, but I think their reasoning doesn't really hold up.

> Please do not deprive others of going through the same process
> by publishing your solution outside Project Euler.

I'm not depriving anyone of anything. If people search for solution and use them
instead of coming up with one on their own, they are depriving themselves.

### Then why do you use cryptographic hashes of the solutions in your test code?
I don't like the idea of listing the solutions in clear text on GitHub.
At least this way someone has to downloade the repo, download and install lci,
and run the programs.
